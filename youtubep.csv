Very strange…..those subs have the most sophisticated GPS and sonar known to man. How they didn’t detect the object it hit is beyond me??,2021-10-08T15:58:19Z,107
"I&#39;ve been following this issue for quite some time now, and I&#39;m glad to see that you were able to cover the issue so fully. For years and years, the situation between the Philippines and China deteriorated under the radar because of all the broken promises of finances and public works projects. As soon as China knew that the Philippines would never break off ties with the US fully (as much as Duterte toyed with VFW agreement, full knowing that the US was his last defense considering our underwhelming navy), they already knew they would merely be using the Philippines and not actually partnering with them. If you look at projects that actually got started or finished, many were in areas Duterte&#39;s party needed to increase support. In the end Duterte is really turning out to be a modern-day Marcos, pulling the wool over the public&#39;s eye with superficial projects and big promises",2021-08-16T18:14:15Z,8
they should start by stop calling the region SCS and address it by something appropriate like South Asian Sea or something that doesn&#39;t include China in its name.,2021-08-13T10:55:51Z,31

It is ridiculous that most of the warships in South China Seas are coming from countries outside East and South East Asia.<br>ASEAN countries should turn them all away and insist that the region is not for military conflict.,2021-05-03T10:01:33Z,4

I think renaming the &quot;south china sea&quot; is a good place to start. Calling the region &quot;south china sea&quot; is like implying that it&#39;s China&#39;s or belongs to china which is the root of the issue.,2021-07-13T00:44:32Z,119

China is a big bully in the the region and is the regional super power, someone needs to step in and say enough is enough. If people aren&#39;t happy with the US and their allies being involved than you better be happy with over fishing to the point of extinction, Taiwan getting invaded along with many other small countries(South Korea) a long with all the other things the CCP brings with them, like slave labor, organ harvesting, concentration camps, extreme police brutality, and an extremely oppressive government with only their best interests.",2021-08-18T12:58:01Z,0
