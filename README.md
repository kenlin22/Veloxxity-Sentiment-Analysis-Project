# Veloxxity-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
UT Dallas Senior Design Project, Sponsor: Veloxxity

The goal of this project in accordance with the
stakeholder (Sponsor: Veloxxity LLC) requirements is to develop a sustainable and interactive
sentiment analysis that collects viral posts with regards to the international conflicts in the South
China Sea. The application will be deployed as a Representational state transfer (REST) API with
the objective of providing a solution to the distribution of misinformation on online social media
platforms.
